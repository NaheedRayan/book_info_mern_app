# MERN stack app
# Getting Started with Book Info app

This repo is all about the MERN stack. 

To show how the MERN stack works, we’ll first configure the server side by connecting Node.js and Express.js to MongoDB on the backend. Then, we’ll create some APIs. After that, we’ll walk you through building the frontend, using React to build our user interfaces. Once both are complete, we’ll have to connect the frontend to the backend.

The links I have followed is [The MERN stack tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-tutorial/).

## How to run

First run the server
``` 
npm start
```
It will run on `http://localhost:8082`

Then run the client
```
npm start
```
It will run on `http://localhost:3000`

Note: You should change the `default.json` file in the `server->config` directory. You will get the link from mongoDB
